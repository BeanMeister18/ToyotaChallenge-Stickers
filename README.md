# toyota-stickers

This repository contains the files created and used in the 2023 Toyota Innovation challenge at the University of Waterloo. I worked in a group to develop an AI program using Jupyter noteboooks and python (Open CV) that can detect and differentiate between dark holes and black circular stickers on different colored surfaces.

Pictures of the program at work can be seen in the "pictures" folder in 'image.png', 'image1.png' and 'image2.png'
