# toyota-stickers

This repository contains the files created and used in the 2023 Toyota Innovation challenge at the University of Waterloo. I worked in a group to develop an AI program using Jupyter noteboooks and python (Open CV) that can detect and differentiate between dark holes and black circular stickers on different colored surfaces.
